VSCode Extensions:
    Needed:
        Python
        Black
        Ruff
            Ruff is rapidly becoming more widespread, I think it's worth adopting
            Formatters/linters used to be integrated thru Python extension, but now they are separate
    Recommended:
        autoDocstring
            Auto generate docstring for function: ctrl shift p > docstring
        GitLens
        Rainbow CSV
        Todo Tree
        Better TOML

Settings:
    Code -> Preferences -> Settings
    1. Search "format on save" and enable this
    2. Search "black", change import strategy to "fromEnvironment"
        This is so we can define it in the project so every programmer uses the same version
    3. Search "ruff", change import strategy to "fromEnvironment"

Setting default formatter:
    ctrl shift p to bring up command menu
    search format
    click format, select Black

pyproject.toml
    This is what most libraries (like ruff or black) use to define their settings
